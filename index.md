title: About me
---

I'm currently a Postdoc
working at the [LuCE research group][]
at [USI (Lugano, Switzerland)][]
advised by professor [Matthias Hauswirth][].
At LuCE we do research at the boundary of programming languages and computer science education.

During my PhD I focused on the use of techniques from Programming Language Theory to construct sound Notional Machines.

I have also done a whole lot of other things in the past,
most of which are superficially described in my [LinkedIn profile][].
