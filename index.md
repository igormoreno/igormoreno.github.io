title: About me
---

I'm currently a Postdoc
working at the [LuCE research group][]
at [USI (Lugano, Switzerland)][]
advised by professor [Matthias Hauswirth][].
At LuCE we do research at the boundary of programming languages and computer science education.

During my PhD I focused on the use of techniques from programming language theory to construct sound notional machines ([dissertation][]).

## What am I up to?

- Expanding our research on sound notional machines
- Applying our ideas about notional machines and program composition to the design of the textbook ([Composition in Java][pf2-book]) we use in our [Programming Fundamentals 2 course][pf2].
- Sprinkling a little bit of Haskell on our [Programming Styles course][ps].
