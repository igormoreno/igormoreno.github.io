title: About me
---

I'm currently a PhD student
working at the [LuCE research group][]
at [USI (Lugano, Switzerland)][]
under the excellent supervision of professor [Matthias Hauswirth][].

My research focuses on the use of Programming Language Theory techniques to construct sound Notional Machines.

I have also done a whole lot of other things in the past,
most of which are superficially described in my [LinkedIn profile][].
